Battleships-Web-App
===================

This is web application for battleships, built during week 5 of Makers Academy, using Sinatra, Ruby and Capybara. The aim was to implement a two-player game without using a database, which was carried out using a global variable for game and session cookies.

Given further time to work on this project, I would like to add some CSS so it looks less sparse, and alert the both players whenever a boat is sunk.
